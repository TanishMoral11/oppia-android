        sha: str. The SHA-256 hash used to validate the archive when it's downloaded.

        test_only: boolean. Whether this archive should be made available only to test targets.

            the same constraints as 'url'. Bazel will use extra URLs as mirrors in case the archive
            is temporarily unavailable from any of the others.
        maven_url_suffix: str. A URL template with the same constraints as 'url' except the
            beginning of the URL is omitted since it will be replaced with a link to one of the
            Maven repositories that the build system depends on. All Maven repositories will be used
            by default for redundancy.
        strip_prefix_template: str. An optional prefix to strip from the directory path imported
            from the archive with optional templating (in the same way as 'url': "{0}" will be
            replaced with the archive's version). See http_archive's 'strip_prefix' for more.
        patches_details: list of dicts. An optional list of patch configurations to apply to the

            create_*_patch_config functions. This defaults to an empty list.
        remote_patch_path_start_removal_count: int. An optional integer specifying the number of
            leading path fragments to remove from remote patches before applying them. This defaults
            to 0, but oftentimes '1' is required as it removes the normal "a/" and "b/" prefixes.

        export_details: dict. An optional dict created using one of create_export_library_details or
